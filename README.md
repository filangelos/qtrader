> Q-Learning for Portfolio Management

## Why Q-Learning?

1. Learns the **optimal action**, rather than models the market.
2. Adaptive to temporary changes of the market, due to its online training.
3. Optimizes the long-term (cumulative) reward, rather than the instantaneous benefit.



## Setup

### macOS

* `source scripts/setup.sh`
